# Specification - Dynamic Consistency Boundary

> **Note:** This document defines the *minimal feature set* an Event Store must provide to be DCB compliant.
>
> While we introduce certain concepts and terminology, **implementations are not required to use the same terms or function/field names** — as long as they offer equivalent functionality. (so `read()` could be `getEvents()` and `failIfEventsMatch` could be `referenceQuery` if those make more sense in your API)

An Event Store that supports DCB provides a way to:

- **read** [Sequenced Event](#sequenced-event)s matching a [Query](#query), optionally starting from a specified [Sequence Position](#sequence-position)
- **append** [Event](#event)(s), optionally specifying an [Append Condition](#append-condition) to enforce consistency

## Reading Events

The Event Store...

- ... *MUST* provide a way to filter Events based on their [Event Type](#event-type) and/or [Tag](#tag) (see [Query](#query))
- ... *SHOULD* provide a way to read Events from a given starting [Sequence Position](#sequence-position)
- ... *MAY* provide further filter options, e.g. for ordering or to limit the number of Events to load at once

A typical interface for reading events (pseudo-code):

```haskell
EventStore {
  read(query: Query, options?: ReadOptions): SequencedEvents
  // ...
}
```

**Note:** `SequencedEvents` represents some form of iterable or reactive stream of [Sequenced Event](#sequenced-event)s

## Writing Events

The Event Store...

- ... *MUST* provide a way to atomically persist one or more [Event](#event)(s)
- ... *MUST* fail if the Event Store contains at least one Event matching the [Append Condition](#append-condition), if specified

A typical interface for writing events (pseudo-code):

```haskell
EventStore {
  // ...
  append(events: Events|Event, condition?: AppendCondition): void
}
```

## Concepts

### Query

The `Query` describes constraints that must be matched by [Event](#event)s in the Event Store.
It effectively allows for filtering Events by their [Type](#event-type) and/or [Tags](#tags).

- It *MUST* contain a set of [Query Item](#query-item)s with at least one item or represent a query that matches all Events
- All Query Items are effectively combined with an **OR**, e.g. adding an extra Query Item will likely result in more Events being returned

To differentiate the two query variants, dedicated factory methods might be helpful:

```haskell
Query.fromItems(items)
Query.all()
```

#### Query Item

Each item of a [Query](#query) allows to target Events by their [Type](#event-type) and/or [Tags](#tags).

An Event, to match a specific Query Item, needs to have the following characteristics:

- the [Type](#event-type) *MUST* match **one** of the provided Types of the Query Item
- the [Tags](#tags) *MUST* contain **all** of the Tags specified by the Query Item

##### Example

The following example query would match Events that are either...

- ...of type `EventType1` **OR** `EventType2`
- ...tagged `tag1` **AND** `tag2`
- ...of type `EventType2` **OR** `EventType3` **AND** tagged `tag1` **AND** `tag3`

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "types": ["EventType1", "EventType2"]
    },
    {
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
    },
    {
      "types": ["EventType2", "EventType3"],
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag3"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Sequenced Event

Contains or embeds all information of the original `Event` and its [Sequence Position](#sequence-position) that was added during the `append()` call.

- It *MUST* contain the [Sequence Position](#sequence-position)
- It *MUST* contain the [Event](#event)
- It *MAY* contain further fields, like metadata defined by the Event Store

#### Example

The following example shows a *potential* JSON representation of a Sequenced Event:

```json
{
  "event": {
    ...
  },
  "position": 1234,
  ...
}
```

### Sequence Position

When an [Event](#event) is appended, the Event Store assigns a `Sequence Position` to it.

It...

- *MUST* be unique in the Event Store
- *MUST* be monotonic increasing
- *MAY* contain gaps

### Events

A set of [Event](#event) instances that is passed to the `append()` method of the Event Store

It...

- *MUST* not be empty
- *MUST* be iterable, each iteration returning an [Event](#event)

### Event

- It *MUST* contain an [Event Type](#event-type)
- It *MUST* contain [Event Data](#event-data)
- It *MAY* contain [Tags](#tags)
- It *MAY* contain further fields, like metadata defined by the client

#### Example

A *potential* JSON representation of an Event:

```json
{
  "type": "SomeEventType",
  "data": "{\"some\":\"data\"}",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
   ...
}
```

### Event Type

Type of the event used to filter Events in the [Query](#query).

### Event Data

Opaque payload of an [Event](#event)

### Tags

A set of [Tag](#tag)s.

- It *SHOULD* not contain multiple [Tag](#tag)s with the same value

### Tag

A `Tag` can add domain-specific metadata to an event, allowing for custom partitioning.
Usually, a Tag represents a concept of the domain, e.g. the type and id of an entity like `product:p123`

- It *MAY* represent a key/value pair such as `product:123` but that is irrelevant to the Event Store

### Append Condition

The Append Condition is used to enforce consistency, ensuring that between the time of building the Decision Model and appending the events, no new events were stored by another client that match the same query.

- It *MUST* contain a `failIfEventsMatch` [Query](#query)
- It *MAY* contain an `after` [Sequence Position](#sequence-position)
  - this represents the highest position the client was aware of while building the Decision Model. The Event Store *MUST* ignore the Events before the specified position while checking the condition for appending events. *Note:* This number can be *higher* than the position of the last event matching the Query.
  - when `after` is present, the `failIfEventsMatch` Query is typically the same Query that was used when building the Decision Model, which guarantees that the Decision Model is still the same when we append new events
  - if omitted, no Events will be ignored, effectively failing if *any* Event matches the specified Query

```haskell
AppendCondition {
  failIfEventsMatch: Query
  after?: SequencePosition
}
```
